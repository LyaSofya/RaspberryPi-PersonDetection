# RaspberryPi-PersonDetection

The project involved setting up a Raspberry Pi with the Raspbian OS, connecting devices like a servo motor, button, LED, and USB camera, and ensuring their proper functionality. The **OpenCV** library was installed for image processing, and sample code tested the camera integration. A circuit diagram was created, and custom code was written to control the devices. The project implemented the **MobileNet** neural network for person detection, where the system captured images, detected a person, and controlled the LEDâ€”turning it on when a person was detected and off when not.



1. Installed the **Raspbian** operating system and connected external devices, testing their functionality.

2. Installed the **OpenCV** library for Raspbian, connected a USB camera, and ran sample code to test the library's capabilities.

3. Developed a circuit diagram for connecting necessary devices (servo motor, button, LED, camera) and wrote code to control these devices.

4. Implemented the **MobileNet** neural network using Raspberry Pi.

5. Developed code to capture images from the camera and detect a person in the image.
